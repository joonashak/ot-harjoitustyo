## Usage

### Run

Compile and run (with Maven):

```bash
mvn compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=fi.basse.shamery.Main
```

### Build

Generate executable JAR with dependencies:

```bash
mvn package
```

> **NOTE:** Current tests have a design flaw due to which they may fail sometimes. If this blocks `mvn package` from completing, simply rerunning the command should suffice. (This notice is here in case I don't have time to fix the issue before this week's deadline.)

### Testing

Run unit tests:

```bash
mvn test
```

Generate test coverage report:

```bash
mvn jacoco:report
```

### Static Analysis

Run `checkstyle`:

```bash
mvn jxr:jxr checkstyle:checkstyle
```
