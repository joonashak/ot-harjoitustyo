## Launching

In your console, go to the directory containing the downloaded `.jar` file and run:

```bash
java -jar Shamery-1.0.jar
```

Depending on your system configuration you should also be able to launch by double clicking the `.jar`.

## Starting a New Game

Upon launching the application, you should be greeted with the following view:

![Main Menu](images/game_view_1.png)

This is the main menu where you should choose between a single player and a multiplayer game.

### Single Player

![Single Player Game Setup View](images/game_view_2.png)

If you select a single player game, the view above will be presented, prompting you to enter your nickname and to choose between the two scoring options, points and timing. Clicking either of these buttons will immediately start a corresponding game.

### Multiplayer

For a two-player game, the view above is essentially the same, just with two fields for the players' names.

## Playing

The game is played by clicking the cards to reveal them. When two cards are open, they can be removed or closed by clicking anywhere on the playing area. See the [rules](./rules.md) for more information on how to score.
