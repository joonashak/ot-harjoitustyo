# Rules

These rules describe the logic for the game and scoring.

## §1 Board

The board is prepared by shuffling a deck of cards and placing them face down on the board. The deck must contain an even number of cards and all cards must have at least one matching pair. The same pair can appear multiple times.

## §2 Number of Players

The game can be played with one or two players.

## §3 Start of Game

The game starts when the player in turn reveals the first card on the board.

## §4 Turn

A turn starts when the player in turn reveals a card. Upon revealing another card, the turn either

 - ends if the cards did not form a matching pair, or
 - continues if a pair was found, with the revealed pair being cleared from the board before revealing the next card.

If playing duel, the turn is passed to the opponent when two non-matching cards are revealed.

## §5 Scoring

### 1. Point-based Scoring

#### 1.1 One Player

One turn equals one point with lower scores considered better.

#### 1.2 Two Players

One revealed matching pair equals one point with higher scores considered better.

### 2. Time-based Scoring

The total time between each turn's beginning and end with faster times considered better. This scoring works the same for one and two players.

## §6 End of Game

The game ends when the last pair remaining on the board is revealed.
